# My First Uniswap V4 Hook

This project is a simple custom **Hook** for [Uniswap V4](https://uniswap.org/), built as part of learning and participating in the Uniswap V4 development community.

## What is this?

- `MyFirstHook.sol` is a basic example of a Uniswap V4 Hook.
- It implements the `IHook` interface.
- Functions `beforeSwap` and `afterSwap` are overridden to demonstrate how hooks can interact with swaps.
